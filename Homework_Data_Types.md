# Background
Thus far, we have been learning about Java and how to print text out to the terminal in Java using `System.out.println(“Text here.”);` But why do we have to use the double quotes ""? If you maybe experimented a little, when we do `System.out.println(32);` or any other number besides 32, we do not need any quotes? Why is that? Hopefully, today's assignment will provide some clarity as to why those quotes are required. This is where the meat of computer programming begins.

# Information About Data Types in Java
What is a data type? A data type, specifically in Java, is some form of data stored in your computer's Random Acess Memory (RAM, also referred to as system memoery). This is super fast memory that stores information our program may need at a later time. A data type can be anything really as we will learn about later, but Java also has it's own built in data types that we can use. These are called primitive data types (in other words, data types built into Java). So, back to our question: what are data types? Data types store specific pieces of information inside of them. Some data types may hold numbers, other data types may hold text. That the purpose of this assignment.

# Assignment
Your assignment this week is to research the different data types in Java. There are a total of eight primitive data types in Java, but we will not cover all eight right away because some can seem very similar and the difference may not immediately be clear to a new programmer. Don't worry, we will cover all eight eventually! This week, I want you to research, understand, and write a few sentences what the following data types mean in Java:
- Integers (referred to as `int`)
- Floating Point / Double (referred to as `float` / `double`)
    - Note: `float` and `double` are actually two different data types. They have a very subtle difference. Defining either will be fine. We will talk about their difference later.
- Boolean
- String

Please define all data types in a Java context. Try not to use websites talking about other languages. While it may be fine,
there may be small differences in the definitions between Java and other languages!

Good luck and have fun!
