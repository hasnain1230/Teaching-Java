# Background
So far, we have discussed four basic, primitive data types. (Note: Primitive means that these data types are built into Java;
they are there by default.) Those are, `double`, `int`, `String` and `boolean`. There are a total of eight primitive data types in Java, but 
we are only going to talk about one more commom data type today. That is `char`. Additionally, for this assignment, we will start to research
and identifiers and variables.

# Assignment
- Fix your `Greetor.java` code. Remember how to read in arguments from the command line and concatenate them to a String.

Addtionally, please answer the following questions in a written document. This will be checked. Please answer thoroughly. 
1. What is a variable in Java?
   1. What is the proper Java syntax for a variable declaration? How would you declare a variable in Java?
   2. What is the difference between initilizing a variable and declaring a variable?
2. What is an identifier?
   1. What is a valid and proper identifier in Java?
   2. What are key words?
3. Write a program that prints "Hello World" ten times (this does not need to be on the document, feel free to do it in any program of your choice).
4. Describe what happens if you omit (remove / don't include) the following in `HelloWorld.java`:
   1. public
   2. static
   3. void
   4. args
5. Describe what happens if you put the double quotes in the print statement of HelloWorld.java on different lines, as in this code fragment:
```
System.out.println("Hello,
                         World");

```
6. What is a literal in Java?
